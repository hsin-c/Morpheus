    "# Cyber Developer Day 2024\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Generative AI (GenAI)** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)** are becoming essential tools in **cybersecurity** in part due to their ability to enhance the efficiency of cyber threat detection and response by **accelerating analyst workflows**. However, prototyping and moving these accelerated workflows into production can be daunting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cybersecurity remains among the top three challenges impacting every industry—from the public sector to financial services, telecommunications, retail, automotive, and more. Most CEOs believe organizations with the most **advanced generative AI capabilities** will have a competitive advantage and are looking for ways to incorporate this into their business. While adversaries are already leveraging generative AI in their attacks, there is significant potential to harness this power for **cyber defense**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This hands-on tutorial will focus on **accelerating an exploitability analysis workflow** to increase analyst productivity and enhance cybersecurity defenses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement: Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) Impact Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Determining the impact of a documented **CVE** on a specific project or container is a labor-intensive and manual task. This intricate process involves the collection, comprehension, and synthesis of various pieces of information to ascertain whether immediate remediation, such as patching, is necessary upon the identification of a new CVE.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Challenges 🚧\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Information Collection:** The process involves significant manual labor to collect and synthesize relevant information.\n",
    "- **Decision Complexity:** Decisions on whether to update a library impacted by a CVE often hinge on various considerations, including:\n",
    "  - **Scan False Positives:** Occasionally, vulnerability scans may incorrectly flag a library as vulnerable, leading to a false alarm.\n",
    "  - **Mitigating Factors:** In some cases, existing safeguards within the environment may reduce or negate the risk posed by a CVE.\n",
    "  - **Lack of Required Environments or Dependencies:** For an exploit to succeed, specific conditions must be met. The absence of these necessary elements can render a vulnerability irrelevant.\n",
    "- **Manual Documentation:** Once an analyst has determined the library is not affected, a **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX)** document must be created to standardize and distribute the results. \n",
    "\n",
    "The efficiency of this process can be significantly enhanced through the deployment of an **event-driven LLM agent pipeline**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tutorial Goals\n",
    "Our team developed a **cybersecurity vulnerability analysis tool** to aid in assessing the exploitability of CVEs in specific projects and containers. This tutorial will guide you step-by-step through the process of using **LLMs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and agents** to create both a toy version and a microservice running **LLM-powered CVE exploitability analysis**.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll have the chance to experiment with various modules, boosting your skills and understanding of these technologies. This experience will prepare you to later expand your use case by exploring new functionalities, enhancing the current setup, or even creating your own tailored solutions to meet specific needs or address new challenges.🚀\n",

    "In this lab, we will be using [NVIDIA NeMo](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/generative-ai/nemo-framework/) as our generative AI platform. NeMo is a cloud-native framework for building, customizing and deploying generative AI models with a familiar ChatGPT-like interface. Utilizing NeMo (or any other generative AI service) in our pipelines allows us to offload the heavy lifting of language model inference to a dedicated service, freeing up our own resources for other tasks. All requests to the NeMo service are made via an HTTP API, which allows us to easily integrate it into our existing codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify the process of interacting with the NeMo service, the NeMo team provides a Python client library (`nemollm`) that wraps the HTTP API. This library provides a simple interface for making requests to the NeMo service, and handles the details of making HTTP requests and parsing the responses. This allows us to focus on the high-level logic of our application, rather than the low-level details of making HTTP requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before sending requests to the NeMo service, we need to set up a NeMo connection object, `conn` which is shown below. We will use the `generate()` method of the connection object to send requests to the NeMo service for the remainder of this section.\n"

    "Evaluating model performance on desired metrics such as `creates a properly formatted list` is relatively straightforward and traditional accuracy measurements (ie. properly formatted outputs/total outputs) can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "For evaluating more subjective outcomes such as `completeness of the checklist` there are other strategies that can be explored for task-specific LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "During this initial experimental stage it makes sense to have expert humans review outputs to determine the model's performance. A common pattern that emerges when developing and evaluating cybersecurity use cases around LLMs is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Experiment using a few golden examples to determine feasibility, and evaluate candidate models and prompts by hand\n",
    "2. Collect feedback on initial model outputs from experts and use this feedback to create a larger dataset\n",
    "3. Use the newly created larger dataset from experts to create a use-case specific training dataset and benchmark dataset\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2.1 - Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to build a language model-based system that accesses external knowledge sources to complete tasks. In [Section 1.3](#1.3---Prompt-Templating), we added additional CVE details into the prompt by hand. While this strategy can be effective for adding additional context for very specific items like CVE Details, it requires a priori knowledge of what details to include (like those from NVD). When you would like to help your LLM with its query by adding more context in real-time, you're ready for RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation).\n",
    "\n",
    "When a query or checklist item is posed to an LLM equipped with RAG, the model first consults the vector database to find relevant information related to the query. This retrieved data is then combined with the original question and fed back into the LLM. With this enriched context, the LLM can generate a more accurate and informed response, potentially including evidence or reasoning based on the newly incorporated data. This approach not only improves the quality of the LLM's outputs and for our tool gives it access to project and container specific information to determine CVE exploitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 - Building the Vector Database\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to having a query and LLM, RAG requires additional information to be stored in a vector database. One mechanism of finding the proper information from the database is to first embed the query into the same vector space and retrieve the top most similar items via a distance metric. The additional information is then presented in the prompt of the LLM. The neighboring vectors in the database are said to be \"semantically similar\" to the query and likely relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our demonstration purposes, we would like our LLM to be able to access the code repository of the project we're interested in checking for exploitable CVEs. The first step is transforming the specific repo into a vector database.\n"

    "\n",
    "When running pipelines which utilize LLMs, it's important to understand how the LLMs are executed to parallelize their execution as much as possible. This is because LLMs can take a long time to run, as low as a few hundred milliseconds and upwards of a few seconds. Running LLMs serially can compound those runtimes leading to execution times that grow linearly with the number of LLM requests. A simple diagram of the execution of LLMs for our CVE pipeline is shown below:\n",

This is not ideal as the execution time of the pipeline is directly proportional to the number of LLMs that are executed. However, there is no dependency between the LLM calls in each of checklist items. This means that we can parallelize the execution of the LLMs to reduce the overall execution time of the pipeline. A simple diagram of the parallel execution of LLMs for our CVE pipeline is shown below:\n",

The total execution time is now the maximum time taken to execute any of the LLM agent chains. This is a significant improvement over the serial execution of the LLMs. But what happens if we need to run the entire pipeline for multiple CVEs? A naive approach would be to run the pipeline for each CVE serially, which is shown below:\n",

The code below is identical to the previous pipeline except we have changed the source from `InMemorySourceStage` to `HttpServerSourceStage`.

It pulls the inputs from the request body and passes them to the pipeline to be processed.\n",
